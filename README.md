# SuperMoby

Super Moby: DeepBlue is a platform (jump ‘n’ run) game similar to the classic “Super Mario'',
which is launched as a desktop application on the user's device. 
The goal of the game is waving the flag at the end of the level in order to win/complete it. On the way there, the player deals
with enemies that try to kill him/her. Super Moby: Deepblue is set in an underwater world, so the
GUI has a corresponding color plate (cold colours) and images. 

Keys to move in game:
   LEFT ->
   RIGHT <-
   SPACE to jump
