# SuperMoby

Super Moby: DeepBlue is a platform (jump ‘n’ run) game similar to the classic “Super Mario'',
which is launched as a desktop application on the user's device. The goal of the game is waving
the flag at the end of the level in order to win/complete it. On the way there, the player deals
with enemies that try to kill him/her. Super Moby: Deepblue is set in an underwater world, so the
GUI has a corresponding color plate (cold colours). The target audience for our app is anyone
who loves playing games. Regardless of their ages they can enjoy Super Moby: DeepBlue.
Our goal is to bring joy into the lives of people with this entertaining game.
